# Future Roadmap for Crypto Trading Bot

This document outlines potential future features and improvements for the trading bot, building upon the stable v6 foundation.

## Phase 1: Enhanced Strategy & Risk Management

The immediate next steps should focus on making the trading strategy more robust and adding critical risk management features.

- **Implement Stop-Loss Orders:** After a successful buy, automatically place a stop-loss order at a configurable percentage below the buy price to limit potential losses.
- **Add More Technical Indicators:** Integrate additional indicators like MACD (Moving Average Convergence Divergence) and Bollinger Bands. This will allow for the creation of more sophisticated trading signals.
- **Dynamic Strategy Selection:** Refactor the trading logic to allow users to select from multiple predefined strategies in `config.py`. This would enable switching between an `RSI_Strategy` and a `MACD_Strategy` without code changes.
- **Trailing Stop-Loss:** For more advanced risk management, implement trailing stop-losses that automatically adjust upwards as the price increases, locking in profits.

## Phase 2: Analytics & Performance Tracking

To properly evaluate the bot's effectiveness, we need better tools for tracking its performance.

- **Upgrade to Database Persistence:** Transition from flat text files to a more robust SQLite database. This would store a full history of all trades, orders, and bot activity, enabling complex queries and analysis.
- **Performance Analytics Module:** Create a new module (`analytics.py`) that can read from the database and calculate key performance indicators (KPIs):
  - Total Profit & Loss (P&L)
  - P&L per trading pair
  - Win/Loss Ratio
  - Sharpe Ratio
- **Generate Reports:** Add functionality to generate simple daily or weekly performance reports in text or HTML format.

## Phase 3: Usability & Monitoring

Improve the user experience and provide better tools for real-time monitoring.

- **Notification Service:** Integrate with a service like Telegram, Discord, or email to send real-time alerts for:
  - Successful buy/sell orders
  - Critical errors or API failures
  - Daily performance summaries
- **Web Dashboard (Advanced):** For a more polished solution, develop a simple, read-only web dashboard using a lightweight framework like Flask or Dash. The dashboard could visualize:
  - Current open positions
  - Recent trade history
  - Live P&L
  - Bot status and logs

## Phase 4: Advanced Capabilities

These are long-term goals that would significantly expand the bot's capabilities.

- **Backtesting Engine:** This is a crucial feature for any serious trading system. A backtester would allow for simulating trading strategies on historical market data to evaluate their effectiveness and optimize parameters before risking real capital.
- **Multi-Exchange Support:** Refactor the `coinbase_client.py` module to use a generic `ExchangeClient` abstract base class. This would allow for implementing clients for other exchanges (e.g., Binance, Kraken) that conform to the same interface, making the bot exchange-agnostic.
- **Machine Learning Integration:** As a research-oriented goal, explore the use of machine learning models to forecast price movements or identify optimal entry/exit points, potentially as an additional signal for the existing strategies.
